# Car Racing Game Prototype  

## Overview  
The **Car Racing Game Prototype** is a JavaFX-based simulation of a car race featuring dynamic elements that influence gameplay. The game calculates race times, determines winners, and incorporates obstacles that impact vehicle performance.  

## Features  
- 🚗 **Dynamic Racing Mechanics** – Two cars race from a unique start stop to a unique end stop, passing multiple checkpoints.  
- ⚡ **Speed Influencing Factors** – Engine type and wheels impact acceleration, max speed, and stability.  
- 🚧 **Obstacles Affect Gameplay** – Randomly placed obstacles like slippery oil spills can cause sliding and speed reduction.  
- 🎨 **Graphical UI** – The game includes a visually rich interface with car selection, difficulty settings, and real-time race updates.  
- 📊 **Race Management System** – RaceController handles game flow, obstacle interactions, and result calculations.  
- 🎵 **Audio Support** – Immersive sound effects enhance the racing experience.  

## Planned Features  
- 🏎️ **Pit Stop System** – Future updates may introduce refueling, tire changes, and repair mechanics.  
- 🌦 **Weather Effects** – Possible future expansion includes weather conditions affecting track performance.  
- 📈 **Race Analytics** – Tracking player stats and performance over multiple races.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Language:** Java  
- **Framework:** JavaFX  
- **Architecture:** MVC (Model-View-Controller)
